          <b>LIBRARY</b>
          <p>
            The concept of ‘E-library’ is going to materialize from this
            session, though there are an ample amount of hard copies of
            reference materials and literature for students from its
            establishment in 2062. There is a trend of adding a sufficient
            amount of current versions of reference materials and textbooks
            including best-selling literature from home and abroad to make the
            library updated and lively. The library subscribes daily national
            and local newspapers, periodicals, and magazines for up-to-date news
            of the world. All students enrolled in this Mahavidyalaya can be the
            member of the central library and get the book of their interest for
            certain periods of time frequently.

          <b>Hostel</b>
          <p>
            In this Mahavidyalaya, the male students must stay in the hostel as
            the residential students whereas the female students are completely
            day scholars. However, the girls who are preparing for the board
            exams of classes 10, 11, and 12 may be residential for few months as
            per their parents’ request. In this academic session 2078, there are
            573 students in this Mahavidyalaya. All the residential students are
            accommodated in the four houses namely Kanchanjunga, Sagarmatha,
            Annapurna, and Dhaulagiri along with housemasters, assistant
            housemasters, and house guards who take care of them round the
            clock. In order to discipline the students living in the houses of
            this Mahavidyalaya and to assist them in their studies, housemasters
            of different subjects have been appointed in each house. Attempts
            have been made to alleviate the loneliness of the students by
            involving them in various programs on holidays. The various
            activities conducted in the hostel are mentioned in the academic
            calendar of the Mahavidyalaya and are conducted in a systematic
            manner. Competitive spirit has been developed in the students living
            in different houses of this Mahavidyalaya by organizing sports
            competitions from time to time. Such competitive events held on
            special days or occasions; create a fun atmosphere by removing the
            loneliness of the students. In order to make the students feel
            social responsibility, the activities including cleaning inside and
            outside the Mahavidyalaya during the holidays are remarkable.
            Students have developed the habit of making good use of time and
            completing their work on time when they have to follow different
            time schedules in winter and summer.
